## Problems
  - The most common problem reported with the 3.0L is the camshaft position sensor. Learn more about it [HERE.](https://www.therangerstation.com/tech_library/camshaft_position_sensor.shtml)
  - Head gasket failures are also common when the cooling system is neglected -- An issue to watch out for is air in the coolant system when you refill it. One of the hoses has a point that is actually higher than the radiator and can allow an air pocket if not filled properly.

## Modifications
  - See [TRS Page](https://www.therangerstation.com/tech_library/3_0performance.shtml)
  - Consider changing gear ratio to improve low end performance (e.g. 3.73's to 4.10's)
