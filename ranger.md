## Problems
  - The most common problem reported with the 3.0L is the camshaft position sensor. Learn more about it [HERE.](https://www.therangerstation.com/tech_library/camshaft_position_sensor.shtml)
  - Head gasket failures are also common when the cooling system is neglected -- An issue to watch out for is air in the coolant system when you refill it. One of the hoses has a point that is actually higher than the radiator and can allow an air pocket if not filled properly.

## Modifications
  - See [TRS Page](https://www.therangerstation.com/tech_library/3_0performance.shtml)
  - Consider changing gear ratio to improve low end performance (e.g. 3.73's to 4.10's)

## Regular maintenance

  - grease transmission input shaft splines? -- very light coat (not enough to fling onto clutch disc).  Type of grease is a hot issue -- moly grease, "spline lube", brake parts grease...
  - inspect U-joints:
    - driveshaft
  - inspect seals:
    - oil pan gasket
    - rear main seal
    - transmission input / output

  Smoke Signals (from [TRS](https://www.therangerstation.com/tech_library/Exhaust.shtml)):
  - Blue smoke from a tailpipe indicates that engine oil is being burned, and that unburned hydrocarbons (HC) are being released into the air.
  - Black smoke from a tailpipe indicates that the air-fuel mixture is too rich to burn completely.
  - White smoke is steam, and is normally visible on a cold day. However it can also indicate an internal engine coolant leak, especially if accompanied by a pungent odor.

## Transmission
## Clutch

As far as I can tell, the clutch contained in the Ford OEM clutch _kit_ ([# 7L596](https://parts.ford.com/shop/en/us/transmission/clutch-parts/kit-clutch-repair-7844563-1)) is exactly identical to LUK 07140 ([clutch only -- $117 @ RockAuto](https://www.rockauto.com/en/moreinfo.php?pk=4698552&cc=1446380&jsn=780)), except for the Ford logo.  The slave cylinder contained in the Ford kit is mostly plastic, as is typical.  The kit also includes a pilot bearing.  I opted for a National pilot bearing # FC65354.

[greasing the input shaft spline](https://www.sachsperformance.com/en/sachs-service-greasing-clutch-disc-hub-spline) -- grease only the input shaft, so that excess is pushed back and not forward.  Use very little -- don't want grease flinging onto disc.  Popular lube choice is a moly paste. "* a small quantity of heat-resistant, aging-resistant, high performance grease with MoS₂ (e.g. Castrol Olista Longtime 2 or 3*" [(source)](https://www.repxpert.com/en/mediadocument/LuK-0056/en)

Ford Ranger & Mazda B-Series Pickup Clutch Hydraulic Release System Bleeding Procedures - [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgNTDGwcjZc) - [part 2](https://youtu.be/91IYY_YENRw)
[Bleeding External Clutch Hydraulic Release Systems with Bleed Screws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pZHTeLS4ik)

**Special bleeding requirements:** *The mounting position of the master cylinder on the firewlal traps air in the rear portion of the cylinder.  Before bleeding, remove the master cylinder from the fireweall and position it so the reservoir end is higher than the push rod end.  This will enable air ot escape from the rear portion of the cylinders.  For addition info, refer to Ford bulletin #93-12-19*
