## extensions

Some of my favorite plugins:  

- [Eneroth Solid Tools] -- _"Solid tools designed to feel more native to SketchUp than the native solid tools."_
- [CleanUp³] -- fix / purge / merge / repair -- requires [TT\_Lib²]
- [Solid Inspector²] -- _"Select a group or component and activate the tool for an analysis of what would prevent it from being a solid manifold."_ An example usage: Solid Tools such as Trim require objects to be true solids.
- [Material Replacer] -- _"Replace one material for another by picking material in the model"_ -- requires [TT\_Lib²] -- __SketchUp has ([material replacement built-in](https://help.sketchup.com/en/sketchup/adding-colors-and-textures-materials#replace-material)) but it seems to only work within a modelling context, i.e. within a group.__
- [Auto Invisible Layer] -- When enabled, changes SketchUp's default behavior of new layers being enabled in all scenes.  Disabled by default at the start of each session.
- [Turn Off Layer In All Scenes (TOLIAS)] --  Turns off the _active_ layer in all scenes.  I also made a version which turns ON a layer in all scenes (I think I just had to edit one line in the code).
- [Material Tools] -- requires [TT\_Lib²]
- [Axes Tools] -- _"Small utilty that reset the axis of components to their bounding box' centre or corners."_
- [Eneroth Component Replacer] -- _"Swiftly pick up any component or group and replace others with it."_
- [FredoScale] -- "...Orientate the selection box around a set of objects and interactively apply a number of geometric transformations, such as Scaling, Tapering, Stretching, Plane Shear, Twisting, Bending and Rotation..."_ -- Requires [LibFredo].
- [FredoGhost] -- Automates proxy modelling, temporarily swapping complex models with simplified "ghost" versions which are generated by the plugin. This improves performance, and also allows display of multiple styles at once. -- Requires [LibFredo].

And here are some interesting extensions I haven't tried yet:  

- [Selection Toys]
- [Architect Tools]
- [TrueBend]
- [ClothWorks]
- [Eneroth Fractal Terrain Eroder]
- [Profile Builder]
- Weld
- Vertex Tools
- Quad Face Tool
- Split Donut / Split Sausage
- SubD
- Joint Push Pull
- FredoCorner / Round corners
- Push Line
- [Eneroth Material Extractor]
- [TIG: SKM Tools, Material Tools, and Image Tools]

## controls

The way we control the software has a huge impact on the experience and the speed of modeling.  When I try and use SketchUp on someone else's computer, it's maddeningly slow.

I use a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubbavox/notes_public/master/assets/WASD.jpg" target="_blank">WASD</a> hand position (gaming-style), and have chosen shortcuts based on ergonomics / frequency of use.

To further ergonomify, I've swapped a couple of keys around on the keyboard, using [SharpKeys]: \
`Control` <--> `Caps` \
`Esc` <--> `~`

## my setup

### folders
- In *Window > Preferences* I set all folders (except templates) to a location within my design directory, on an SSD.
- templates cannot be relocated from `%appdata%\SketchUp\SketchUp 2020\SketchUp\Templates\`
- My desktop & laptop use the same folder structure (incl. drive letters), to ease syncing & backups. (Only one `Preferences.dat` backup file needed.)

### interface
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubbavox/notes_public/master/assets/sketchup_screenshot_UI.png" target="_blank">screenshot</a>
- I separate the trays into 4 or 5 tabs, and assign keybinds to the most important ones.  Some workflows might have different priorities, but this is my typical setup:
  - Entity Info - I put this one in a small floating window, and toggle it with a keybind (E)
  - Main - Materials, Styles, Components, Shadows, Fog, Soften Edges
  - Outliner (alt + A)
  - Tags (alt + S)
  - Scenes (alt + D)
- toolbars: (set to use small icons)
  - Large Tool Set
  - Section
  - Shadows
  - Solid Tools
  - Styles
  - Views
  - [Eneroth Solid Tools]
  - [Solid Inspector²](https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/solid-inspector%C2%B2)

### other settings
  - Speedy styles:  For modelling (rather than for rendering or for Layout usage) I tweak the style for speed, disabling extra lines such as profiles.
  - For most of my styles I set line weight to minimum because it helps with the problem of lines showing through thin solids.
  - To make it easier on my eyes, I create a dark backdrop: I disable ground, set background to dark gray, and sky to black (which actually results in a gradient sky, black to light gray).
  - I disable shadows on ground, in shadow options.  Even if ground is disabled in the style, shadows will still be rendered where it used to be.
  - In an attempt to speed up startup time, I disable the welcome screen & auto-updates, and I put everything on SSD.

### backups
By default, SketchUp autosaves to a temp file, and if the program crashes it offers to load that file.  For extra protection, I use [Bvckup2](https://bvckup2.com/) to save a timestamped copy of the current project folder every 15 minutes, up to 4 copies. I also use Bvckup2 to periodically copy my files to the cloud (OneDrive), and to a separate disk.

## saving & restoring settings
- keyboard shortcuts & folder locations: these settings can be imported / exported to a single file, separately or combined.
- interface customization: not straightforward, if even possible.  If I'm reinstalling, I play it safe & start from scratch with UI
- extensions: SketchUp installs extensions in `%appdata%\SketchUp\SketchUp 2020\SketchUp\Plugins`.  I just copy my backup `\Plugins` folder and SketchUp loads the plugins -- I have yet to experience issues with this process.
- templates: Similar to extensions, templates are stored in `%appdata%\SketchUp\SketchUp 2020\SketchUp\Templates`.
- Layout

### nested materials & the *default* material:

The *Default* material is a special material.  It's sort of a blank; a `nil` value for an object's material; an invisible placeholder (that by default displays as white on the front face, and blue on the back face.)

If an entity (group, component, face, etc) contains different materials within its child entities, SketchUp has a way of prioritizing what materials are actually shown. 

**My interpretation:**  If an entity is painted with a non-default material, it is rendered on each child entity unless that child entity has non-default material(s) of its own.

In other words, if an entity is unpainted (painted with *default*), it's like an invisible primer, which shows the material underneath, and can be painted over.  But if an entity is painted with a normal material, it won't stick to other materials, and likewise can't be painted over.

**Example:** \
(`raw geometry` refers to one or more faces/edges)

- `face` -- *pink*
  - `eyes` -- *default material*
    - `raw geometry` -- *each face painted its own color*
  - `nose` -- *orange*
    - `raw geometry` -- *default material*
  - `mouth` -- *default material*
    - `raw geometry` -- *default material*

The `eyes` group contains several faces and edges (`raw geometry`).  If we tried to paint the `eyes` group black, it would have no visual effect, because there are nested entities with their own materials.

The `nose` group also contains `raw geometry`, all of which is unpainted -- i.e. has the *default material*. If we painted the `raw geometry` with some materials, it would override the *orange* applied to `nose`.

The `mouth` group is unpainted -- it has *default material* -- so it inherits the material from above.  Its parent group is `face`, which is painted *pink*, so `mouth` renders as *pink*.  Also note it's the only entity rendering *pink*.  If we painted the `mouth` group *gold*, it would override its parent material and render as *gold*.

### component materials workflow
If you paint a component, it doesn't apply to that component's copies -- you're painting the instance of the component.  Here are 2 example heirarchies which let you easily paint all copies of a component in bulk.
- workflow A:
  - *component* - default material
    - *raw geometry* - `custom material` (quickly paint all faces by holding `shift` while painting)
- workflow B:
  - *component* - default material
    - *group* - `custom material`
      - *raw geometry* - default material

### managing materials
#### collections
Lorem markdownum tandem in multa pressus Lucifero telum tutissimus ignes. Ne
Latina, atque flexile tutus vivosque superbus averserisque facit. Parentum non
forma quae, aut sub vacuos iam sonus veniensque adventum Metione. Precando
carinas.

#### custom materials

Ima dumque; [res](http://www.solvere-tamen.io/sed.html) bis requiescere ego tuo,
ictu alter loqui di. Parantur amoris quoniam [umbris](http://incerto.io/colla),
diverso, tuli primo Ladon cum? Aegea non Iuppiter dumque. Siccata et vestigia
tantos quoque Ascalaphus apertas tamen, cognoscere. Tamen aequora sibi terra,
in, Minervae, in.

## axes

Axes are an important tool, because they determine Sketchup's inferencing.  In other words, they determine the alignment or positioning of various tools, such as rotation, scaling, lines & shapes. There are multiple sets of axes within a model: In addition to the model axes (top-level context), each group or component has its own set of axes.  

Axes can be adjusted: You can set the origin and the direction of each of the 3 axes.  And they are adjusted per context.  This gives you control over how SketchUp inferences within each group or component. 

Examples:
- 
- If you need to scale a solid along a weird angle, you can set the axes to that weird angle, and it will update the scale tool handles accordingly.  

- axes tool
- align axes (to face)
- reset axes
