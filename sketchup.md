## extensions

**My essential plugins:**
- [Selection Toys]
- [Eneroth Solid Tools] -- _"Solid tools designed to feel more native to SketchUp than the native solid tools."_
- [Solid Inspector²] -- _"Select a group or component and activate the tool for an analysis of what would prevent it from being a solid manifold."_ An example usage: Solid Tools such as Trim require objects to be true solids.
- [CleanUp³] -- requires [TT_Lib²] -- fix / purge / merge / repair
- [Auto Invisible Layer] -- When enabled, changes SketchUp's default behavior of new layers being enabled in all scenes.  Disabled by default at the start of each session.
- [Turn Off Layer In All Scenes (TOLIAS)] --  Turns off the _active_ layer in all scenes.  I'm working on my own modified version which also turns _on_ a layer in all scenes.
- [SketchUp Shapes]
- [Eneroth Legacy Save]


**Some more of my favorite plugins:**
- [Material Replacer] -- requires [TT_Lib²] -- _"Replace one material for another by picking material in the model"_. __SketchUp has [material replacement built-in](https://help.sketchup.com/en/sketchup/adding-colors-and-textures-materials#replace-material) but it seems to only work within a modelling context, i.e. within a group...(investigate)__
- [Eneroth Visual Merge] -- $ / trial -- automagically hides lines & faces where selected groups touch, making them appear to be seamless.
- [Component Properties] -- requires [TT_Lib²]
- [SubD] -- $ / trial
  - [website](https://evilsoftwareempire.com/subd)
  - [manual](https://evilsoftwareempire.com/subd/manual)
  - [SubD forum @ Sketchucation](https://sketchucation.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=397)
- [Quad Face Tools] -- requires [TT_Lib²]
  - [wiki](https://github.com/thomthom/quadface-tools/wiki)
  - [other quad extensions](https://evilsoftwareempire.com/subd/quads/extensions)
- Vertex Tools -- $ / trial -- [website](https://evilsoftwareempire.com/vertex-tools)
  - [manual](https://evilsoftwareempire.com/vertex-tools/manual)
- [Material Tools] -- requires [TT_Lib²]
- [Axes Tools] -- requires [TT_Lib²] -- _"Small utilty that reset the axis of components to their bounding box' centre or corners."_
- [FredoScale] -- Requires [LibFredo] -- "...Orientate the selection box around a set of objects and interactively apply a number of geometric transformations, such as Scaling, Tapering, Stretching, Plane Shear, Twisting, Bending and Rotation..."_
- [FredoGhost] -- Requires [LibFredo] -- Automates proxy modelling, temporarily swapping complex models with simplified "ghost" versions which are generated by the plugin. This improves performance, and also allows display of multiple styles at once.
- [Archiver] - Automates the saving of archive/option versions of the project.
- [Pipe Along Path] - Turns lines into pipes -- great for plumbing!
- [Eneroth Pipe] -- $ / trial -- similar to Pipe Along Path but probably better
- [Selection Memory] 

**Here are some interesting extensions I haven't tried yet:**

- [Profile Builder] - $ / trial

## controls

Keyboard shortcuts are crucial for my efficiency & ease of modelling. When I try and use SketchUp on someone else's computer, I find it maddeningly slow.

I use a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubbavox/notes_public/master/assets/WASD.jpg" target="_blank">WASD</a> hand position (gaming-style), and have chosen key assignments based on ergonomics / frequency of use.

To further ergonomify, I've swapped a couple of keys around on the keyboard, using [SharpKeys]: \
`Control` <--> `Caps` \
`Esc` <--> `~`
  
<details>

## my setup

### folders
- In *Window > Preferences* I set all folders (except templates) to a location within my design directory, on an SSD.
- templates cannot be relocated from `%appdata%\SketchUp\SketchUp 2021\SketchUp\Templates\`
- My desktop & laptop use the same folder structure (incl. drive letters), to ease syncing & backups. (Only one `Preferences.dat` backup file needed.)

### interface
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubbavox/notes_public/master/assets/sketchup_screenshot_UI.png" target="_blank">screenshot</a>
- I separate the trays into 4 or 5 tabs, and assign keybinds to the most important ones.  Some workflows might have different priorities, but this is my typical setup:
  - Entity Info - I put this one in a small floating window, and toggle it with a keybind (E)
  - Main - Materials, Styles, Components, Shadows, Fog, Soften Edges
  - Outliner (alt + A)
  - Tags (alt + S)
  - Scenes (alt + D)
- toolbars: (set to use small icons)
  - Large Tool Set
  - Section
  - Shadows
  - Solid Tools
  - Styles
  - Views
  - [Eneroth Solid Tools]
  - [Solid Inspector²](https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/solid-inspector%C2%B2)

### other settings
  - Speedy styles:  For modelling (rather than for rendering or for Layout usage) I tweak the style for performance, disabling extra lines such as profiles.
  - For most of my styles I set line weight to minimum because it helps with the problem of lines showing through thin solids, and I think it just looks better.
  - To make it easier on my eyes, I create a dark backdrop: I disable ground, set background to dark gray, and sky to black (which actually results in a gradient sky, black to light gray).  And maybe one day we'll get dark mode!
  - I disable shadows on ground, in shadow options.  Even if ground is disabled in the style, shadows will still be rendered where it used to be.
  - In an attempt to speed up startup time, I disable the welcome screen & auto-updates, and I put everything on SSD.

### backups
By default, SketchUp autosaves to a temp file, and if the program crashes it offers to load that file.  For extra protection, I use [Bvckup2](https://bvckup2.com/) to save a timestamped copy of the current project folder every 15 minutes, up to 4 copies. I also use Bvckup2 to periodically copy my files to the cloud (OneDrive), and to a separate disk.

## saving & restoring settings

[helpful thread @ SketchUp forums](https://forums.sketchup.com/t/toolbars-and-setup-when-updating/115002/4)

- **keyboard shortcuts & folder locations:** these settings can be imported / exported to a single file, separately or combined.
- **custom UI:**  I think this might be possible, but it's not straightforward, and I've not tested it sufficiently. On a fresh install, I customize the UI from scratch.
- **plugins:** SketchUp installs plugins in `%appdata%\SketchUp\SketchUp 2021\SketchUp\Plugins`.  I typically save the plugin download `.rbz` files, and reinstall from these, but the safest method is to re-download each plugin, noting compatibility with the version of SketchUp you're using (and some plugins might work with the new version even if they don't say so).
- **templates:** Similar to extensions, templates are stored in `%appdata%\SketchUp\SketchUp 2021\SketchUp\Templates`. Note: this folder location cannot be customized in SketchUp preferences.
- Layout

## materials
plugin: [Material Replacer] - requires [TT_Lib²] \
plugin: [Material Tools] - requires [TT_Lib²] \
plugin: [TIG: SKM Tools, Material Tools, and Image Tools] \
plugin: [Eneroth Material Extractor] \
article: [batch convert jpgs to skm (sketchup materials)](https://sites.google.com/site/sagesuwiki/tutorials/plugins/tutorials/batch-convert-jpgs-to-skm)

### nested materials & the *default* material:

The *Default* material is a special material.  It's sort of a blank; a `nil` value for an object's material; an invisible placeholder (that by default displays as white on the front face, and blue on the back face.)

If an entity (group, component, face, etc) contains different materials within its child entities, SketchUp has a way of prioritizing what materials are actually shown. 

If an entity is painted with a material, that material is also rendered on each child entity unless that child entity has non-default material of its own.

In other words, if an entity is unpainted (painted with *default*), it's like an invisible primer, which shows the material underneath, and can be painted over.  But if an entity is painted with a normal material, it won't stick to other materials, and likewise can't be painted over.

### component materials workflow
If you paint a component, it doesn't apply to that component's copies -- you're painting the instance of the component.  Here are 2 example heirarchies which let you easily paint all copies of a component in bulk.
- workflow A: 
  - *component* - default material
    - *raw geometry* - `custom material` (you can quickly paint all faces by holding `shift`, or select multiple faces before painting)
- workflow B:
  - *component* - default material
    - *group* - `custom material`
      - *raw geometry* - default material

## Axes & Inference

SketchUp Help Articles:
- [*Adjusting the Drawing Axes*](https://help.sketchup.com/en/sketchup/adjusting-drawing-axes)

**Inference:** SketchUp will try to *infer* what you are trying to do, based on axes, symmetry, and helpful imaginary lines.  Examples: Line tool will snap to lines which are perpindicular or parallel to nearby shapes (and turn pink); the cursor will snap to the midpoint of a line; the cursor will snap to the center of a circle, if you first hover the circle's edge and then move cursor inward.

**Axes:** Axes are an important tool, because they determine Sketchup's tool alignments & influence inference cues. For example, scaling & rotation are aligned with the axes. There are multiple sets of axes within a model: In addition to the model axes (top-level context), each group or component has its own set of axes.

Axes can be adjusted: You can set the origin and the direction of each of the 3 axes.  And they are adjusted per context.  **Axis direction** determines how SketchUp inferences within each group or component, and determines compass alignment: Solid red is north, and solid green is east.  **Axis origin point** affects how entities are imported / pasted, and probably other things.
