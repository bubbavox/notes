## extensions

Some of my favorite plugins:  

- [Eneroth Solid Tools] -- _"Solid tools designed to feel more native to SketchUp than the native solid tools."_
- [CleanUp³] -- fix / purge / merge / repair -- requires [TT\_Lib²]
- [Solid Inspector²] -- _"Select a group or component and activate the tool for an analysis of what would prevent it from being a solid manifold."_ An example usage: Solid Tools such as Trim require objects to be true solids.
- [Material Replacer] -- _"Replace one material for another by picking material in the model"_ -- requires [TT\_Lib²]
- [Auto Invisible Layer] -- When enabled, changes SketchUp's default behavior of new layers being enabled in all scenes.  Disabled by default at the start of each session.
- [Turn Off Layer In All Scenes (TOLIAS)] --  Turns off the _active_ layer in all scenes.  I also made a version which turns ON a layer in all scenes (I think I just had to edit one line in the code).
- [Material Tools] -- requires [TT\_Lib²]
- [Axes Tools] -- _"Small utilty that reset the axis of components to their bounding box' centre or corners."_
- [Eneroth Component Replacer] -- _"Swiftly pick up any component or group and replace others with it."_
- [FredoScale] -- "...Orientate the selection box around a set of objects and interactively apply a number of geometric transformations, such as Scaling, Tapering, Stretching, Plane Shear, Twisting, Bending and Rotation..."_ -- Requires [LibFredo].
- [FredoGhost] -- Automates proxy modelling, temporarily swapping complex models with simplified "ghost" versions which are generated by the plugin. This improves performance, and also allows display of multiple styles at once. -- Requires [LibFredo].

And here are some interesting extensions I haven't tried yet:  

- [Selection Toys]
- [Architect Tools]
- [TrueBend]
- [ClothWorks]
- [Eneroth Fractal Terrain Eroder]
- [Profile Builder]
- Weld
- Vertex Tools
- Quad Face Tool
- Split Donut / Split Sausage
- SubD
- Joint Push Pull
- FredoCorner / Round corners
- Push Line

## controls
I use a [WASD][WASD] hand position (gaming-style), and have chosen shortcuts based on ergonomics / frequency of use.

I've swapped a couple of keys around on the keyboard, using [SharpKeys]: \
`Control` <--> `Caps` \
`Esc` <--> `~`

## my setup

### folders
- In *Window > Preferences* I set all folders (except templates) to a location within my design project directory.
- templates: unchangeable location: `%appdata%\SketchUp\SketchUp 2020\SketchUp\Templates\`
### interface
[screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubbavox/notes_public/master/assets/sketchup_screenshot_UI.png)
- I separate the trays into 4 or 5 tabs, and assign keybinds to the most important ones.  Some workflows might have different priorities, but this is my typical setup:
  - Entity Info - I put this one in a small floating window, and toggle it with a keybind (E)
  - Main - Materials, Styles, Components, Shadows, Fog, Soften Edges
  - Outliner (alt + A)
  - Tags (alt + S)
  - Scenes (alt + D)
- toolbars: (set to use small icons)
  - Large Tool Set
  - Section
  - Shadows
  - Solid Tools
  - Styles
  - Views
  - [Eneroth Solid Tools]
  - [Solid Inspector²](https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/solid-inspector%C2%B2)

### backups
By default, SketchUp autosaves to a temp file, and if the program crashes it offers to load that file.  For extra protection, I use [Bvckup2](https://bvckup2.com/) to save a timestamped copy of the current project folder every 15 minutes, up to 4 copies. I also use Bvckup2 to periodically copy my files to the cloud (OneDrive), and to a separate disk.

## saving & restoring settings
- keyboard shortcuts & folder locations: these settings can be imported / exported to a single file, separately or combined.
- interface customization: less straightforward.  I usually just start from scratch.  
- extensions:
- Layout
