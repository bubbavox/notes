# Soldering

## tools
[soldering tools article @ keeb.io](https://docs.keeb.io/soldering-tools/)
### solder:
  - Diameter: "0.031" jsolder is good for general usage. For SMD components which are smaller, 0.020" is recommended."
  - leaded: Typical Tin/Lead Ratio: 63/37 or 60/40
  - unleaded:
  - silver:
  - rosin-core - basically, has a flux core.  use this for electronics
  - acid core - don't use for electronics
### iron & tips:
  - new tips need to be broken in for ~1hr?
  - cone tip is versatile and precise
  - wedge tip good for batteries, medium wires, etc...

## how to solder

[nice how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2Jf8cebwCs)

  - prep iron:
    - keep clean
    - tap excess solder off & clean with wet sponge or coil etc
    - tin tip / wipe / tin tip / solder
  - tin the iron tip
  - pre-tin some things like braided wires
  - typical: heat the piece, apply solder directly (rosin core burns off quickly)
  - wire splicing: 
    - braid the wires together.  
    - pre-tin if desired 
  - temps:
    - typical temps: 315-370C (600-700F)
    - surface-mount: 315
    - big PCB components -- ~ 370C (700F)

## how to de-solder
  - melt joints more easily with a little fresh solder 
#### tiny stuff, surface mount, etc
  - temp ~ 315
