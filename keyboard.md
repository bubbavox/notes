### PCB

### hotswap sockets

[Mill-max 7305-0-15-15-47-27-10-0](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Mill-Max/7305-0-15-15-47-27-10-0?qs=%2Fha2pyFadugftNJCRxiOOwqKNrTG4vZoDh9pyJZgPMI6W1rFOopWSlGzFvj96Axw)

**issue:** the F-row thru-holes are wider, for some reason, and soldering the sockets in will be less straightforward.  I might put the sockets on the switch pins, and mount the switches on the plate or the board, and then solder the sockets.

Compared to the popular choice [0305-2-15-80-47-80-10-0](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Mill-Max/0305-2-15-80-47-80-10-0?qs=QtQX4uD3c2Uys0ai6Tr8NQ%3D%3D), these 7305 sockets are more flush to the PCB, and protrude less out the back.  On the keyboard I tested, the 0305 sockets prevented plate-mount switches from seating fully.  The 7305 with its shorter tail might be a bit harder to solder, but I don't think it will be a problem.
